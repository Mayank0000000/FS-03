        <h3>Event capturing refers to the process in which an event is first captured by the outermost element and 
            then propagated inward towards the target element where the event took place . <br>
            In event bubbling  when the event occurs , it travels upwards in the DOM tree straight till root document
            element covering all the parent element of the target element. <br>
            An example scenario where event bubbling would occur is when a user clicks on a button within a nested set 
            of HTML elements. The click event would be triggered on the button element first, and then it would bubble
             up through the hierarchy of parent elements until it reaches the top-most parent element. <br>
             Suppose we have a large HTML document with multiple nested elements, and we want to handle a click event on a 
             specific element, but we only want to handle the event if it was triggered on a certain nested element, and 
             not on any of its parent elements. In this case, we can use event capturing to ensure that the event is 
             captured first by the specific nested element before it propagates to its parent elements.

        <h1>Question 2.a</h1>
        <div class="myDiv">
            <button class="btn">Click</button>
            

        </div>

        <h3>Event propagation is a mechanism that defines how events propagate or travel through the DOM tree to arrive 
            at its target and what happens to it afterwards. First capturing phase takes place where the event is generated
             in the document root element and travels toward the target element. After that bubbling phase takes place in which then
             the event travels upwards to the document root element. So, both capturing and bubbling combined is called 
              event propagation
              <br> Suppose there are nested elements and I want to mofify them differently using click event. 
            In place of clicking the individual element I can  click the child element and then the 
            click event will travel to its parent elements and modification will be done in just a single click.</h3>
